Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

```php
<?php
  require 'redcarpet.php';
  $app = new App();
```

I think you should use an `<addr>` element here instead.
